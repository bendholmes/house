It's been a hectic couple of days to say the least!

After going back and forth on pretty much every available lot in Silver Star, Ben and I finally admitted to ourselves that we really needed to see the land in person. So, we bundled ourselves - and the kitties into the car - and made the drive up to Vernon.

*Death glares from Kira and Fable, but they actually handled the trip really well!*

The day before we left there was a major storm warning over most of western BC, and the Coquihalla got absolutely pummeled with snow. Things were much better when we drove, but a number of dicey patches meant the journey ended up taking just under 7 hours. We arrived at 9pm, got the car stuck on a mound of snow when trying to park, checked into our room and then headed out for some nighttime viewings.

The views were incredible, but we forgot to take any pictures so you'll just have to imagine them. We'll get better at this documenting marlarkey I promise!

Then it was a socially distanced meal in our hotel room, an early night and up the next morning for a dash of skiing before we met our builder at the lots.

*I'd love to claim that the skiing was just to test whether various lots were *actually* ski in/out, but i'd be lying (although that was a big part of it!)*

Our second walkround was during daylight hours which gave us a much better perspective on what the land is actually like, and we think we've narrowed our search down to just two! Ironically, neither of these lots were particularly on our radar before visiting, so it's definitely been a worthwhile trip for that if nothing else! 

*Ben took some great photos on his SLR, more will be up on [instagram](https://instagram.com/silverchalet) soon.*

Next steps are to actually make our mind up about which lot we like best (it's going to be so hard!) and then try and come up with an offer that the sellers accept. 

Fingers crossed everyone!
